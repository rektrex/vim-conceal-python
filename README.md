# vim-conceal-python
Render ligatures in place of some operators with vim conceal.

Replaces a few operators in python with unicode symbols in *vim. This plugin is for minimal replacements similar to what a font with ligatures would do. For more replacements, consider using [this](https://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python) plugin instead.

## Replaced Operators
==, !=, <=, >=, <<, >>

## Installation

Place python.vim into ~/.vim/after/syntax or ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax or use a plugin manager.
